# Book_review
This is a project in django where user will signup and give reviews on books they find useful.


Hint: I am making this project to sharpen my knowledge of Python/Django. So throughout this project, you will get a step-by-step process of what I did and how I did it.
Requirements:
pycharm or any other IDE 
Python 

I created a GitHub repo to store and track my project. **https://github.com/Rakeshtolangi/Book_review**   
I installed GitHub Desktop, which gives the best possible way to push and update your progress while working on your project. **https://desktop.github.com/**
**Sign up with your GitHub on GitHub desktop and set up your repo there.**

** 1.01 creating a project and app, and starting the development server.
    1. Open the terminal and run the command to create the bookr project directory
    **django-admin startproject bookr**
    This command will create a project directory where all the projects are structured.
    2. In your terminal, change to the bookr project directory and then run
            python3 manage.py runserver.
    Using the above command starts the Django development server.
You should see the following screen on your machine.
